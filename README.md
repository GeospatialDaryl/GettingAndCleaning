This repo shares the results of generating summary tables for the human interface data set.

The data set was filtered to contain only variable means and standard deviations for all measurements.  From these data, summary stats of mean values for all factor levels are performed.  This corresponds to each subject ('subject') and the mechanical activity performed.
